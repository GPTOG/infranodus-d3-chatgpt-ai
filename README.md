## InfraNodus is a text-to-network visualization tool, based on Neo4J Graph Database, Node.Js, Sigma.Js, and Graphology.


#### [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) is a web app that can represent plain text as a graph. Every word is a node, every co-occurrence is a connection. We build a graph and apply network science algorithms to get insights about the connections in this graph. So you can encode any text or anything you want into a graph using #hashtags and @mentions). InfraNodus will visualize it, so you can analyze it.

## The Science and the Method

InfraNodus is a non-commercial [venture fiction](https://noduslabs.com/research/venture-fiction/) project. Its main objective is to enhance perception and imagination, although it can also solve concrete problems and offer you an efficient way to retain, process, and make sense of information. It can:

* Help researchers make sense of textual data
* Help you retain and remember information
* Help you connect disjointed bits and pieces of data
* Visualize patterns in complex relations
* Be used for text network analysis
* Be used to quickly create graphs using text / voice input
* Perform comparative visual analysis of texts
* Identify the structure of discourse (dispersed / biased)
* Reveal the gaps in a network (and, thus, the potential for new ideas/connections)
* Provide network metrics, identify the main communities and top nodes

The method is mainly based on the approach outlined in Paranyushkin (2011) **[Identifying the Pathways of Meaning Circulation Using Text Network Analysis](https://noduslabs.com/research/pathways-meaning-circulation-text-network-analysis/)**.

A more precise description of InfraNodus' algorithm is presented in Paranyushkin (2019) **[InfraNodus â€” Generating Insight Using Text Network Analysis](http://bit.ly/infragitpdf)** (published in the [Proceedings for the WWW'19 The Web Conference](http://bit.ly/infragitacm)). If you use the tool, you can cite this paper.

A more easy-to-read article on the tool is published in **[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/measuring-discourse-bias-using-text-network-analysis-9f251be5f6f3)**.


##
## Mobile Interface

InfraNodus can also be used on a mobile.
